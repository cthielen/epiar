 * \brief			Image loading and display
 * \details
 * You don't have to worry about OpenGL's power of 2 image dimension requirements.
 * This class will scale for you while still displaying correctly.
 * When editing this class, there are a number of curious variables and conventions to
 * pay attention to. The real width/height of the image (rw, rh) is rarely used - it is
 * the true width and height of the image according to OpenGL. However, as we often expand
 * images whose dimensions weren't a power of two, but must be for proper OpenGL texture
 * size requirements, we may internally expand the dimensions of the image (thus the rw,rh grow)
 * but the w/h is still effectively (at least as far as we care on the outside) whatever non-
 * power of two dimensions, and these effective, "fake" dimensions are called it's _virtual_
 * dimensions, or virtual width/height, stored in w, h.
